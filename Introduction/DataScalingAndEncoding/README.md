Buildig ML trainig set: Introduction(Importance of pre-processing the dataset)

There are numerous options available to scale and encode the features and labels in your dataset to get the best out of machine learning algorithms. Explore training such as standardizing, normalizing, one-hot encoding, and more.

Trying to explore why scaling and encoding is important.

We will explore the use of various scaling tools available in Scikit-learn:
1. Standard Scalar,
2. Normalizer,
3. The min-max scaler

Encoding techniques such as:
1. label encodig
2. one hot encoding
